    <span class="me_tit animate ">I am a college student from UCSD, Class of 2023. I am double major in Computer Science and Applied Mathematics. In my life, I am an artistic youth passionate about music and sports, and I also like to read book and watch TV and movies. My music style is quite broad: having played the violin for more than 10 years, I love to play some classic music pieces such as New World Symphony, Canon in D, The Rain, etc. Besides, I am familiar with guitar, piano, and drums. My devotion for music is what pushes me to found a band with my friends. Although I did achieve this goal with my college friends in 2019, because of the covid-19 pandemic, we draft apart after only few months of rehearsal. Now, it has been more than 1 year since we departed from college. Are we still able to continue our journey with shoshin? <br/>
In addition to music, I have many other hobbies like Rubik’s cubes. The first time I got exposure to Rubik’s cube is in the year of 2009. When this little cute cube became popular in our class, my parents also bought me one. At that time, I could only solve the cube without regard to time. My interest in Rubik’s cube reaches the peak in 2016 when I saw a Chinese TV show, “Super Brain”. Watching how these geniuses solved various cubes in a short time, I started to dive deep into these as well: second-order, third-order, fourth-order, Pyraminx, Skewb, Magic Dodecahedronm, and blindfold. Now, I am holding national records: 7,000+ for third-order, 5,000+ for second-order, and 1,000+ for Pyraminx. Even though these rankings are not very outstanding, they are recognitions for my continual efforts over the past few years. I have passed the golden year of learning Rubik’s cube, so I probably won’t participate in WCA (World Cube Association) competitions anymore. But I genuinely hope that Rubik’s cube can accompany me on the rest of my life journey.

      This is the song that our band rehearsed in 2019. Every time I hear it, I unwittingly recall our passion for music when we first meet. We are drawn together because of music. Hope that we can keep our love for music when we finally part.
